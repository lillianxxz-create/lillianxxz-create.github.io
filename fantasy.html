    <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: 700;">Thoughts and Reviews</p>
    <p style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic; margin-left: 2%;">Babel</p>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Excellent world building. I was very impressed by how Kuang illustrated the use of silver bars in the world. It felt very natural.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Too much show not tell for character development, but the friendship dynamics and how they changed over time was beautifully written. The betrayals and tension were conveyed extremely well. It hurted to see friends who were once so close form conflicts that could not be resolved.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">The deaths absolutely crushed me. Was not expecting them.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Some of the plot dragged on too long. It was nice to know how hard Robin's studies were at Oxford, but I think there could've been less of it.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">In contrast, some of the crucial plot scenes happened very very fast. They were over before I could register what happened. Overall, the pacing was a bit wonky in this book.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Quotes
        <ul>
        <li>"London was, like Canton, a city of contradictions and multitudes, as was any city that acted as a mouth to the world" (pg. 46)</li>
        <li>"But the answer was obvious - that they were all four of them drowning in the unfamiliar, and they saw in each other a raft, and clinging to one another was the only way to stay afloat" (pg. 173)</li>
        <li>"because true love took time and memories, but as close to love as first impressions could take them" (pg. 172)</li>
        <li>"They used to find solace in their solidarity, but now they saw each other only as reminders of their own misery" (pg. 361)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <p style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic; margin-left: 2%;">The Poppy War</p>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Loved the Chinese influences. However, I feel like some of them were not very accurate. The keju was not easy enough for someone to get the highest mark in the nation with only a few months of studying.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Kuang included great discussions about religion and the soul being a separate entity from the phsyical body.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">The character development was even worse than it was in Babel (dare I say it was nonexistent). Rin kept making the same mistakes and it was frustrating to read. This is a major reason why I DO NOT recommend this book.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Props to Kuang for including historical background from the Nanjing Massacre and Unit 731. Reading chapters 21 and 22 made me sick. As a Chinese, the imagery hit a bit too close to home. </li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Safe to say I will not be reading the rest of triology :( Rin was just not a great protagonist.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Quotes
        <ul>
        <li>"He had a kind and soothing voice, the sort of tone Rin had heard village physicians adopt before amputating limbs" (pg. 75)</li>
        <li>"Dress them in spare uniforms, stick them in a boat, and send them down the river (this passage takes inspiration from the Chinese story 草船借箭 from The Three Kingdoms)" (pg. 152)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <p style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic; margin-left: 2%;">Never Keep</p>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">This was a fun read. Nothing serious. I cannot wait for the second book to come out this April. World-building and plot was engaging. The plot twists absolutely blew my mind away.</li>
