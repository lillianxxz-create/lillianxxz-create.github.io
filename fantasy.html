    <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: 700;">Thoughts and Reviews</p>
    <p style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic; margin-left: 2%;">Babel</p>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Excellent world building. I was very impressed by how Kuang illustrated the use of silver bars in the world. It felt very natural.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Too much show not tell for character development, but the friendship dynamics and how they changed over time was beautifully written. The betrayals and tension were conveyed extremely well. It hurted to see friends who were once so close form conflicts that could not be resolved.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">The deaths absolutely crushed me. Was not expecting them.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Some of the plot dragged on too long. It was nice to know how hard Robin's studies were at Oxford, but I think there could've been less of it.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">In contrast, some of the crucial plot scenes happened very very fast. They were over before I could register what happened. Overall, the pacing was a bit wonky in this book.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Quotes
        <ul>
        <li>"London was, like Canton, a city of contradictions and multitudes, as was any city that acted as a mouth to the world" (pg. 46)</li>
        <li>"But the answer was obvious - that they were all four of them drowning in the unfamiliar, and they saw in each other a raft, and clinging to one another was the only way to stay afloat" (pg. 173)</li>
        <li>"because true love took time and memories, but as close to love as first impressions could take them" (pg. 172)</li>
        <li>"They used to find solace in their solidarity, but now they saw each other only as reminders of their own misery" (pg. 361)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <p style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic; margin-left: 2%;">The Poppy War</p>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Loved the Chinese influences. However, I feel like some of them were not very accurate. The keju was not easy enough for someone to get the highest mark in the nation with only a few months of studying.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Kuang included great discussions about religion and the soul being a separate entity from the phsyical body.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">The character development was even worse than it was in Babel (dare I say it was nonexistent). Rin kept making the same mistakes and it was frustrating to read. This is a major reason why I DO NOT recommend this book.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Props to Kuang for including historical background from the Nanjing Massacre and Unit 731. Reading chapters 21 and 22 made me sick. As a Chinese, the imagery hit a bit too close to home. </li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Safe to say I will not be reading the rest of triology :( Rin was just not a great protagonist.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Quotes
        <ul>
        <li>"He had a kind and soothing voice, the sort of tone Rin had heard village physicians adopt before amputating limbs" (pg. 75)</li>
        <li>"Dress them in spare uniforms, stick them in a boat, and send them down the river (this passage takes inspiration from the Chinese story 草船借箭 from The Three Kingdoms)" (pg. 152)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <p style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic; margin-left: 2%;">Never Keep</p>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Loved this book so much I devoured it in 5 days!?!</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">I finally found a recently published fantasy book with a strong female character. Both Everest and Vesper are not without flaws, as they grapple with their respective trauma and personal goals. However, their actions are justified and the character development is quite well write in this book (I'm excited to see how their friendship will grow).</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">This was a fun read. Nothing serious. I cannot wait for the second book to come out this April. World-building and plot was engaging. The plot twists absolutely blew my mind away.</li>
    <p style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic; margin-left: 2%;">Assassin's Apprentice</p>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">The worldbuilding in this book is amazing. The magic system is unique, and, although some of the background info dumps at the start of each chapter was hard to get through, easy to understand. I found myself deeply immersed in the world of Buckeep, and this book is an example of why I love fantasy.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Overall, the language is quite simple, yet character relationships are touching and historical parallels to medieval Europe are vivid.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">There are parts of the book that seem incredibly slow paced and harder to get through, but the amount of action we get after Fitz goes into the mountains is insane. Very enthralling.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">I would highly highly recommend this book if you enjoy fantasy. Even if you don't, I think Hobb's storytelling skills are worth a try.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Quotes
        <ul>
        <li>"All events, no matter how earthshaking or bizzare, are diluted within moments of their occurrence by the continuance of the necessary routines of day-to-day living" (pg. 55)</li>
        <li>"who ware his extravagant clothes as if they were armor against time" (pg. 177)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <p style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic; margin-left: 2%;">Echo Fort</p>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">I didn't like the second book as much as I did the first, and I surmise it's because Echo Fort is more plot heavy. There wasn't as much character development, and so much was happening that I often felt overwhelmed with all the plot.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Quotes
        <ul>
        <li>"In this world, everyone had to earn their good moments, but I'd never realised they might stop coming entirely" (pg. 71)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <p style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic; margin-left: 2%;">Royal Assassin</p>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">I think I'm falling in love with Robin Hobb's writing.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">This book had me on the edge of my seat (pretty much) the entire time. There were sections where the pacing felt extremely sluggish, causing me to stop reading and almost become disinterested.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Hobb manages to depict the politics of Buckeep so well. Chade disappearing for a while, King Shrewd's declining health, Prince Verity's death, and all the other major plotlines really reinforce how Hobb understands the complexity of a royal family.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">I'll admit that Fitz's decision to keep on seeing Molly and continuing his secret relationship irked me endlessly throughout the book. I understood his frustration at his lack of autonomy and his genuine love for Molly, but I cannot help but think it foolish of him to endanger the both of them due to impulsive desires.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">I cannot wait to read the next book!!</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Quotes
        <ul>
        <li>"I don't think you'd want her pity. It's a poor substitute for love" (pg. 22)</li>
        <li>"This is what it really feels like to be old. Not sick, where one might get better. Old. When each day can only be more difficult, each month is another burden to the body" (pg. 40)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
